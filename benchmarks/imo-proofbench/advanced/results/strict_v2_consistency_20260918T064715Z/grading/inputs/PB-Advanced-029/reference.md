The answer is all even $k$. Let's abbreviate $S(n):=\binom{n}{0}^{k}+\cdots+\binom{n}{n}^{k}$
 for the sum in the problem.


 \textbf{Proof that even $k$ is necessary.}

  Choose $n=2$. We need $3\mid S(2)=2+2^{k}$, which requires $k$
 to be even.


 \textbf{Proof that even $k$ is sufficient. }

 From now on we treat $k$ as fixed, and we let $p^{e}$ be a prime
 fully dividing $n+1$. It is sufficient to prove that $S(n)$ is a
 multiple of $p^{e}$ for each such $p^{e}$. The basic idea is to
 reduce from $n+1$ to $(n+1)/p$ by an induction. We prove the following
 lemma on each individual binomial coefficient.


 \textbf{Lemma. }Suppose $p^{e}$ is a prime power which fully divides
 $n+1$. Then

 \[
 \binom{n}{i}\equiv\pm\binom{\frac{n+1}{p}-1}{\lfloor i/p\rfloor}\quad\left(\bmod p^{e}\right)
 \]

 \emph{Proof.} If we write
 \[
 \binom{n}{i}=\prod_{1\leq j\leq i}\frac{n-(j-1)}{j}
 \]

 then the fractions for $p\nmid j$ are all $\pm1\left(\bmod p^{e}\right)$.
 So only considers those $j$ with $p\mid j$; in that case one obtains
 the claimed $\binom{\frac{n+1}{p}-1}{\lfloor i/p\rfloor}$ exactly
 (even without having to take modulo $p^{e}$).


 From the lemma, it follows if $p^{e}$ is a prime power which fully
 divides $n+1$, then
 \[
 S(n)\equiv p\cdot S\left(\frac{n+1}{p}-1\right)\quad\left(\bmod p^{e}\right)
 \]

 by grouping the $n+1$ terms (for $0\leq i\leq n$ ) into consecutive
 ranges of length $p$ (by the value of $\lfloor i/p\rfloor$ ) and
 the result follows by induction.
