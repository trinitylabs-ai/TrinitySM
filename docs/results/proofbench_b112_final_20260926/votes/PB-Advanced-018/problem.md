For given integers $n \ge 5$ and $k \ge 1$, we color each of the $n^2$ cells of an $n \times n$ grid using one of $k$ colors. If $q$ is the largest integer which is not larger than $\frac{n^2}{k}$, then, each of the $k$ colors must be used to color exactly $q$ or $q+1$ cells. A sequence of $n$ different cells $c_1, c_2, \ldots, c_n$ in the grid is called a \textit{snake} if it satisfies the following conditions simultaneously:

 \begin{enumerate}
 \item[(a)] For each $1 \le i \le n-1$, two cells $c_i$ and $c_{i+1}$ are adjacent to their sides,
 \item[(b)] For each $1 \le i \le n-1$, cell $c_i$ and cell $c_{i+1}$ are colored with different colors.
 \end{enumerate}
 Let $a(n)$ be the minimum $k$ such that a snake exists regardless of the method of coloring. Find a constant $L$ that satisfies the following inequality and prove it:

 \[
 |La(n)- n^2 | \le n +2 \sqrt n + 3 \;.
